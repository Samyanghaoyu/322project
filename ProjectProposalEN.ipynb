    "# CPSC 322 Final Project Proposal  \n",
    "## Classifying Meteorite Fall Types Using NASA's Meteorite Landings Dataset  \n",
    "### Team Members: Junyou Guo, Haoyu Yang\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses the NASA “Meteorite Landings” dataset to predict how meteorites were discovered on Earth. Meteorites are recorded in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fell**: The meteorite was observed falling and documented.  \n",
    "- **Found**: The meteorite was discovered on the ground with no witnessed fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to apply data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and three different classifiers (including a self-implemented random forest) to predict whether a meteorite is Fell or Found. We will evaluate and compare classifier performance and identify the best-performing model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source:** NASA Open Data Portal  \n",
    "**Link:** https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh  \n",
    "**Format:** CSV  \n",
    "**Instances:** 34,513  \n",
    "**Attributes:** 8+  \n",
    "\n",
    "Primary fields in the dataset include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **name** – meteorite name  \n",
    "- **id** – unique identifier  \n",
    "- **recclass** – meteorite classification type (>100 classes)  \n",
    "- **mass (g)** – mass in grams  \n",
    "- **year** – year of fall or discovery  \n",
    "- **fall** – Fell / Found (classification label)  \n",
    "- **reclat, reclong** – geographic coordinates  \n",
    "- **geolocation** – normalized coordinate representation  \n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset is large, heterogeneous, and includes both categorical and continuous features, making it highly suitable for a classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Classification Task\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Predict whether a meteorite is **Fell** or **Found** (binary classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reasons for choosing this task:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The label is clear, meaningful, and perfectly suited for classification.  \n",
    "2. Continuous attributes (mass, year, latitude, longitude) create non-linear patterns.  \n",
    "3. The data is imbalanced (Found is more frequent), allowing a deeper discussion of evaluation.  \n",
    "4. Noisy entries (missing years, extreme mass values) make preprocessing non-trivial.  \n",
    "5. The relationships between features and the label are scientifically meaningful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This task meets the project requirements and offers interesting complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Technical Content and Implementation Plan\n",
    "\n",
    "### (1) Data Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handle missing values (e.g., missing year or invalid coordinates)  \n",
    "- Remove or cap extreme outliers in mass  \n",
    "- Group or encode highly granular recclass categories  \n",
    "- Discretize continuous features when needed (e.g., for Naive Bayes)  \n",
    "- Validate geolocation ranges  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### (2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will generate the following visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Class distribution of Fell vs Found  \n",
    "- Mass distribution (log scale)  \n",
    "- Recclass category frequency  \n",
    "- Relationship between year and fall type  \n",
    "- Latitude/longitude scatterplot  \n",
    "- Correlation heatmap among numeric attributes  \n",
    "\n",
    "These insights will guide feature engineering decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### (3) Classifier Design and Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement and evaluate three classifiers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Decision Tree (entropy-based)**  \n",
    "2. **k-Nearest Neighbors or Naive Bayes**  \n",
    "3. **MyRandomForestClassifier (self-implemented)**  \n",
    "\n",
    "The random forest will follow the required structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use bootstrapping to generate train/validation splits  \n",
    "- At each node, randomly select F candidate attributes  \n",
    "- Train N trees and select the best M based on validation accuracy  \n",
    "- Use majority voting for prediction  \n",
    "\n",
    "We will experiment with multiple combinations of (N, M, F) and repeat runs with different random seeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Anticipated Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imbalanced Fell vs Found class distribution  \n",
    "- Large variety of recclass categories  \n",
    "- Mass has a wide numerical range → may require log-transform  \n",
    "- Missing or malformed year values  \n",
    "- Implementing TDD for MyRandomForestClassifier is time-consuming  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Feature Selection Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use EDA to assess relevance of mass, year, latitude, and longitude  \n",
    "- Use feature importance from the random forest  \n",
    "- Use correlation metrics for numeric attributes  \n",
    "- Apply discretization for probabilistic models  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Potential Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "This project can support:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Meteorite research and planetary science  \n",
    "- Impact risk modeling and geoscience studies  \n",
    "- Automated meteorite identification systems  \n",
    "- Public scientific education and data storytelling  \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding fall patterns provides insight into meteorite distribution, historical impact events, and human detection bias.\n",

    "This project applies the full data science pipeline including preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, classifier implementation, parameter tuning, and comparative analysis. Using NASA’s real-world meteorite dataset, the work meets the technical depth and complexity expected for the CPSC 322 final project and has meaningful scientific relevance.\n"
